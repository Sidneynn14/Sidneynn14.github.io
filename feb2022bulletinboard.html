            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>Here I've provided a bit of information about the origins of Black History Month and the historical context of why many people celebrate.</p>	
            <h2>The History</h2>
            <p>Dr. Carter G. Woodson, the "father of Black history", was always a strong proponent of the education of Black history and culture. He believed that contributions to society by Black individuals were too often overlooked. In 1915, Dr. Woodson and minister Jesse E. Moorland founded the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (ASNLH), an organization dedicated to researching and promoting achievements by Black Americans and other peoples of African descent. This organization then sponsored a national Negro History week in 1926. This was held during the second week of February in order to coincide with the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. In the coming years, “National Negro History Week” gained immense traction and was celebrated nationwide.</p>
            <p>During the Civil Rights movement (in the 1960s), was when many began to celebrate for the entire month of February. However, it wasn’t until 1976 when President Gerald Ford officially recognized Black History Month that it became nationally recognized to honor the legacy of Black people in America.</p>
            <p>Black History month is still celebrated today because the contributions of Black individuals to society continue to be overlooked, and Black history continues to not be taught in schools as a part of American history and world history. Hopefully, this month we can all learn something new about Black history.</p>
