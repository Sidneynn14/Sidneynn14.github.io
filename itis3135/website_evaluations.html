            <p>Site rating for C.R.A.P. design principles(1-10):</p>
            <ul>
               <li><strong>Contrast</strong>: 9, Headers stand out from the text and direct the readers attention easily. Also, the colors of the site do not clash but appear to match the same theme mostly.</li>
               <li><strong>Repitition</strong>: 7, Font size and colors are mostly consistant with text of the same type. Paragraphs are consistant in look</li>
               <li><strong>Alignment</strong>: 8, There are a few different alignments on the page, but overall, images are aligned with images and paragraphs are aligned with paragraphs. The header and footer is also well organized.</li>
               <li><strong>Proximity</strong>: 7, Content is sectioned off well and flows from subject to subject with clear indication of what is where. The homepage does showcase many things, which forces the user to do some scrolling and searching.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Bad: <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/about/resources/courses">Yale School of Art Courses Page</a></h3>

            <p>Site rating for C.R.A.P. design principles(1-10):</p>
            <ul>
               <li><strong>Contrast</strong>: 3, The information and links in the header and footer do not stand out from the background. Also, all text in the body is the same size, and some of the background colors are jarring when placed in the same theme.</li>
               <li><strong>Repitition</strong>: 6, Text size and font are constant, however, the color theme is not.</li>
               <li><strong>Alignment</strong>: 8, All elements are lined up evenly across the page(minus the header and footer).</li>
               <li><strong>Proximity</strong>: 7, While similar elements are grouped together (such as discription and listed courses), there is no space between courses which makes so much text difficult to read. </li>
