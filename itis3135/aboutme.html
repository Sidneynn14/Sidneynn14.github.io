          <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> Hi, I am Sidney Nesbitt from Roxboro, NC. I graduated from the North Carolina School of Science and Math in 2020 and am now currently a sophomore at the University of North Carolina Charlotte (UNCC). I have a dog named Bell and outside of computer science, I have interests in horticulture and textile art.</li>
          <li><strong>Proffesional Background:</strong> My first official job was as a sales associate at Lowes Home Improvement Store in the summer of 2021. I currently work as a Resident Advisor at UNCC for Levine Hall.</li>
          <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Major: Computer Science</li>
              <li>Minor: Environmental Science</li>
              <li>Cumulative GPA: 3.8/4.0</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Course Background:</strong> I prevously took a web design class in highschool where I learned the basics of how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create webpages.</li>
          <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Windows 10</li>
          <li><strong>Courses Taking & Why:</strong> 
            <ul>
              <li>BIOL-2130 General Biology II: This course is a prerequisite to UNCC's horticulture course, which I am excited to take and learn more about plant biology.</li>
              <li>ITCS-3160 Database Design & Implementation: This is also a required course for me, but database maipulation is turning out to be very interesting.</li>
              <li>ITIS-3135 Web App Design & Development: While I do have basic skills in the subject, I would like to become comfortable with website manipulation.</li> 
              <li>ITSC-3146 Intro to Operation Systems & Networking: My father works as a Networking Engineer and I am excited to finally understand what he's talking about.</li>
              <li>LBST 2301 Critical Thinking and Communication(HONR): This course satifies my love of writing and inquiry. I can't take all STEM classes.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Story Time:</strong> When I first came to UNC Charlotte, I cut off a piece of one of the snake plants in the Student Union. It's growing in my dorm room right now, but I don't know where I'll put it if it gets as big as the plant I took it from.</li>
          <li><strong>Final Interesting Tidbit:</strong> I am a vegan who loves baking.üå±</li>
